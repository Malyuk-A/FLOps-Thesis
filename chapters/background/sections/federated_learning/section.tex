\section{Federated Learning}\label{section:federated_learning}

This section contains necessary background information and context regarding FL.
The first subsection covers fundamental FL building blocks and terminologies.
The next subsection explains vital supplementary FL concepts.
Oakestra orchestrates FLOps.
It uses an unconventional three-tiered structure that allows support for geographical clusters \cite{paper:oakestra_usenix}.
This structure opens up unique opportunities for FL applications.
More advanced FL architectures are necessary to benefit from these opportunities.
The following subsection discusses these architectures.
These three subsections build a solid FL understanding.
A great summary and source of information for deeper insights into the field of FL can be found in \cite{book:fl}.
