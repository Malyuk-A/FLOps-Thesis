\chapter{Background}\label{chapter:background}

To properly understand FLOps as a whole and why it combines different techniques, it is necessary to analyze them individually.
This analysis includes critical background knowledge of their benefits and downsides.
Only afterward does it make sense to discuss how FLOps merges them to create something new.

This background chapter provides a general overview of each sector and discusses aspects necessary for FLOps in greater detail.
The first section explores the field of federated learning.
FL is the core task at hand that FLOps aims to optimize.
A thorough understanding of this discipline is required to determine its shortcomings.
The following section discusses established best practices from DevOps and MLOps to improve upon these weaknesses.
Techniques like automation and CI/CD require infrastructure and resources.
Orchestration enables provisioning, management, and deployment of such infrastructure and resources.
Its section reviews orchestration technologies and provides a short overview of Oakestra as the chosen platform for FLOps.
In the final background section, a couple of existing works resembling FLOps are examined and compared.
