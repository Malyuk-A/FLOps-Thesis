\chapter{Introduction}


In the last several years, the number of smart devices has been rapidly growing and generating enormous amounts of data (BigData).
Improvements in connectivity (Cloud Computing \& Internet of Thingsâ€”IoT), connection speeds (5G), and computing power enable this development.
Combined with the expansion of AI/ML, this data is a driving factor for current successful workflows and future advancements.
This complementing union of technologies plays a key role in elevating various domains to Industry 4.0 and beyond.
Examples include agriculture, healthcare, education, and the security sector \cite{paper:ai_edge_iot_review}.
Diverse and complex challenges arise from this swiftly evolving landscape.
