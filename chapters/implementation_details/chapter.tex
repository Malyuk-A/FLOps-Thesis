After discussing requirements and simplified system models, this chapter discloses significant details of the implementation that powers FLOps.
We implemented FLOps mainly in Python.
Our goal is to use state-of-the-art tools for FLOps.
We analyzed and compared different open-source libraries and tools.

Table \ref{table:implementation_details_notion_subset} shows a heavily abbreviated subset of our internal comparison.
We refrain from exploring and discussing our findings to avoid bloating the thesis.
Especially because this landscape is constantly changing, and better options might exist since our analysis. 
We carefully considered every dependency that FLOps relies upon.
The dependency listings are available in the codebase \cite{flops_code}.
