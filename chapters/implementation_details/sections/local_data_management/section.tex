\section{Local Data Management}

This section explains how FLOps handles local data on learner nodes.
Firstly, it covers what kind of data and datasets suit FL and why.
Secondly, it discusses how state-of-the-art projects in the industry handle enormous amounts of data for ML and Big Data applications.
Thirdly, it explores how exactly FLOps manages the local data and what architecture it uses for this task.
The last subsection showcases FLOps' mock data provider service, which makes development and testing more convenient.
