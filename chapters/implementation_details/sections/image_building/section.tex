\section{Image Building}

From our understanding the automatic image build process that turns user ML code into FL-capable containerized multi-platform images is one of the major novel contributions of this work.
This process is a non-trivial endeavor requiring advanced understanding and application of various domains.
This chapter is dedicated to analyzing these required synergies.
Firstly, it elaborates on the need to build these images and explains related challenges.
Secondly, it discusses different approaches and their limitations in building images in the given environment.
Thirdly, this chapter showcases details about internal FLOps image builder processes.
The last subsection explains how FLOps handles multi-platform image builds.
