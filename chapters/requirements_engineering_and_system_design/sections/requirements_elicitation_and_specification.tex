\section{Requirements Elicitation \& Specification}
Requirements engineering combines requirements elicitation and analysis.
Requirements elicitation is an activity used to specify requirements.
The problem statement (\ref{section:problem_statement}), objectives (\ref{section:objectives}), and weaknesses found in the FL field (\ref{subsection:fl_research}) are inputs to elicit requirements.
These requirements are specified, analyzed, and concretized. 
Requirements elicitation and analysis are cyclically connected.
After requirements are specified, they get analyzed, which can start another elicitation process.
With each cycle, the understanding and specification of the requirements improve.
This section derives functional and nonfunctional requirements based on the Requirements Analysis Document Template by Br√ºgge et al. \cite{book:bruegge}.
