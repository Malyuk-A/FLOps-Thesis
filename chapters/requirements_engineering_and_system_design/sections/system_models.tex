\section{System Models}

After eliciting and specifying requirements, this section presents abstractions such as analysis models representing how the system satisfies these requirements.
The models do not depict the exact implementation.
Instead, they show a simplified conceptual representation of FLOps' architecture and workflows.
This includes involved components and their relationships.
The goal is to improve comprehension of the system instead of showing overwhelmingly verbose intricate details that might change in future updates.

System models aim to build what is called an analysis model.
The analysis model has three distinct parts.
Scenarios and use cases form the functional model.
Class and object models make the analysis object model.
State machines and sequence diagrams create the dynamic model of the system. \cite{book:bruegge}
