\chapter{Additional FL Research Paper Analysis}\label{appendix:fl_research}

\subsubsection{Remaining FL Papers}

The following two tables (\ref{table:fl_research_table_2}, \ref{table:fl_research_table_3}) refer to the omitted FL papers that we examined for FLOps.
The main part can be found here (\ref{table:fl_research_table_1}).
Table \ref{table:fl_research_table_2} shows the first half of the remaining FL papers and
table \ref{table:fl_research_table_3} depicts the second half.
When there is no content (-) in the "Limitations \& Future Work" column that means that the authors did not mention any explicitly and that we did not notice anything specifically.

\subsubsection{Futher FL Paper Patterns}

Figure \ref{fig:fl_research_problem_challenge} reveals a similar trend discussed in (\ref{subsection:fl_research}).
The primary focus of the examined FL papers is on investigating new concepts or improving existing performance, scalability, and complexity bottlenecks.
Several papers have aimed to narrow the gap between industry and research or make FL easier to use.
This ease of use seems to focus on improving already configured and working FL setups.
The main contributions seen in Figure \ref{fig:fl_research_contributions} strengthen these assumptions.
Mathematical and conceptual proofs dominate this chart.
They prove that novel architectures and algorithms work as proposed.
Contributions do not seem to focus on improving the initial setup, deployment, and configuration processes.
Figure \ref{fig:fl_research_limitations_future_work} reflects this perception.
If specified, the focal point is on improving privacy and security, further performance optimizations, or adding support for more ML use cases.
Even the future focus is not on optimizing accessibility, usability, or the mentioned initial vital steps.
